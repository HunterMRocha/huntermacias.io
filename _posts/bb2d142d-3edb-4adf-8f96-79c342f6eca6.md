title: Working with Sprites Pt. 2
tagline: smooth game movement
preview: >-
  This is part of this tutorial series, ‚ÄúGame Development with Pygame‚Äù we will
  be going over sprites in PyGame. In addition to this we will cover player
  movement and wall collision.

# Moving to Graphical Sprites
---
>>
>> When you need art for your game, you have 3 choices:
>>
>> Draw it yourself
>> Find an artist to draw it for you
>> Use pre-existing art from the Internet
>>
>> 1 and 2 are fine if you or your friends are artistically inclined, but for most programmers 
>> creating nice-looking art is not in our skill set. So that leaves the Internet, and it‚Äôs very important 
>> to remember that you shouldn‚Äôt use art that you do not have the right to use. 
>> While it‚Äôs easy enough to search and f>>ind a picture of Mario or your favorite Pokemon, 
>> that doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs OK for you to use it in your game, 
>> especially if you plan to put it online and let other people see it.
>>
>> Fortunately, there‚Äôs a good solution: OpenGameArt.org. 
>> This website is loaded with tons of art, sound, music, and more
>>

# Organizing your Game Assets
---

>> First we need a folder to hold our assets, which is a term game developers use to refer to things like art
>> and sound. I called the folder ‚Äúimg‚Äù for short, and I put the player image into it.
>>
>> To use this image in our game, we need to tell Pygame to load the picture file, which means we need our
>> program to know where the file is located. Depending on what kind of computer you are using, this can be
>> different, and we want to be able to run our program on any computer, so we need to load a Python library
>> called os, and then specify where our game is located:
>>

# Python OS 
---

```python
 import pygame
 import random
 import os

 # set up asset folders
 game_folder = os.path.dirname(__file__)
```
>>
>>The special Python variable __file__ refers to whatever folder your game code is saved in, and the command os
>>path.dirname figures out the path to that folder. For example, on my computer, the path to my code is this:
>>
>>/Users/chris/Documents/gamedev/tutorials/1-3 sprite example.py
>>
>>But I‚Äôm using a computer running OS X. If you‚Äôre using Windows, your path might look like this:
>>
>>C:\Users\chris\Documents\python\game.py
>>
>>As you can see, different operating systems use different ways of describing where things are located on the
>>computer. By using the os.path command, we can let the computer figure out what the right path is (whether to us
>>‚Äú/‚Äù or ‚Äú\‚Äù for example.)
>>
>>Now, we can specify our ‚Äúimg‚Äù folder:
>>

```python
 import pygame
 import random
 import os

 # set up asset folders
 game_folder = os.path.dirname(__file__)
 img_folder = os.path.join(game_folder, 'img')
 player_img = pygame.image.load(os.path.join(img_folder, 'p1_jump.png')).convert()
```
>>
>>Now we‚Äôve loaded our image by using pygame.image.load() and we‚Äôve made sure to use convert()
>>which will speed up Pygame‚Äôs drawing by converting the image into a format that will be
>>faster to draw on the screen. Now we‚Äôre ready to replace the plain green square in our sprite 
>>with our fancy player image:
>>

```python
class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        pygame.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self)
        self.image = player_img
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.center = (WIDTH / 2, HEIGHT / 2)
```
>>
>> Notice we‚Äôve deleted the self.image.fill(GREEN) commmand - we don‚Äôt need it to be filled with a solid color
>> anymore. get_rect() will still work just fine, because it looks at whatever self.image is to figure out what the
>> bounding rectangle should be.
>>
>> Now if you run the program, you should see a nice little cartoon alien running across the screen. But we have a
>> problem - one we can‚Äôt see because the background is currently black. Change the screen.fill() command at the
>> bottom to something else - I decided to use BLUE. Now you can see the issue:
>>

>>
>>When you have an image file on the computer, that file is always a rectangular grid of pixels. No matter what shape
>>you‚Äôve drawn, there‚Äôs still a border of pixels filling the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù of your image. What we need to do is tell
>>Pygame to ignore the pixels in the image that we don‚Äôt care about. In this image, those pixels happen to be black,
>>so we can add the following:
>>

# Removing Image Background
---

```python
class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        pygame.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self)
        self.image = player_img
	self.image.set_colorkey(BLACK)
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.center = (WIDTH / 2, HEIGHT / 2)
```

>>
>> set_colorkey() just tells Pygame that when we draw the image we want to ignore any pixels of the specified color.
>> Now our image looks much better:
>>

>> Congratulations, you have now learned the basics of working with Pygame! Now it‚Äôs time to start making a real game. 
>>We have created a few tutorials showing the process of creating a full game from start to finish. They get more
>> complex as we go, so it‚Äôs recommended that you follow them in order.
